# Library Management System

The Library Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the management of library resources, providing both students and administrators with an efficient and user-friendly platform. It has an Admin panel where one can add students, books and other admins if needed. It also keeps track of borrowed books and late fees accordingly. It also has a student portal where students can borrow books on the basis of availability, view their profile and also keep a track of fees due to late returns.
